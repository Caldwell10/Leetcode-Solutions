You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 1
        maxP = 0

        while r < len(prices):
            # profitable
            if prices[l] < prices[r]:
                profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
                maxP = max(profit, maxP)
            else:
                l = r
            r += 1
